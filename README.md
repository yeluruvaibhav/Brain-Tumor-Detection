# DETECTION-OF-BRAIN-TUMORS-USING-HYBRID-MODEL-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-AND-NEURAL-AUTOREGRESSIVE
A Brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cell inside the skull malignant brain tumors are among the most . Dead full type of cancer with
direct consequences such as cognitive decline and poor quality of life
We are presenting detection of brain tumors using hybrid model convolution neural network and Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) models, which are neural network architectures applied
to the problem of unsupervised distribution and density estimation and
hybrid convolution method They leverage the probability product rule
and a weight sharing scheme inspired from restricted Boltzmann machines, to yield an estimator that is both tractable and has good generalization performance distribution of a emulator by the fixable distribution estimator to solve the problem various type of inference problem
classification of a brain tumor region.
